# 📟 Pyxel Matrix

**Pyxel Matrix** is a desktop utility designed for **GB Studio** developers to streamline the creation of complex data structures. By converting visual grids into optimized **GBVM (Game Boy Virtual Machine)** code, it allows for easy management of RPG stats, item databases, and environmental triggers.

### 🛠️ Implementation Example

To retrieve data from the matrix within GB Studio:

1.  **Set Mapping**: Set your `Mapping` variable to the desired coordinate (e.g., `508`).
2.  **Execute Script**: Call the custom GBVM script generated by this tool.
3.  **Result**: Your `Result` variable will now contain the value stored at that coordinate.
